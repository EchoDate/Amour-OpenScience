Typical. He\u2019s echoing someone else\u2019s bitterness instead of owning it. The \u201cunderground\u201d comment? Either poetic nonsense or code for hiding. And now he\u2019s blaming the town, not the institution, not us. Convenient.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nI\u2019m tired of people who won\u2019t look in the mirror.

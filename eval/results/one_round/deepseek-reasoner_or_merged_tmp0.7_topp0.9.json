Okay. That’s something we can work with. Means we’re not chasing ghosts—we’re chasing a name. First step: establish where and when you heard it. I’ll grab an EMF reader and a recorder—standard procedure for vocal phenomena. While I do that, tell me exactly where you were, what you were doing, and whether anything else happened right before or after. Don’t leave anything out, even if it seems small. We’re officially on the clock now, Dana. Let’s not waste time.",

She's pushing for immediate, tangible evidence, which feels like she's trying to force a breakthrough before we're ready.\n</Observation Analysis>\n<Self-Reflection>\nMy nerves are fraying. Her insistence feels like pressure I can't handle right now. I'm the one who deals in invoices and inventory, not detective work. This makes me defensive—I want to point out how reckless this sounds, how evidence doesn't just appear because we need it to.\n</Self-Reflection>\n<State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a little (coupled to her urgency)\nTrust: decrease a little (her pushiness feels reckless)\nDominance: stable (I'm not steering this)\nFocus: increase a little (the pressure to find an answer)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30–0.60]\nTrust: low [0.00–0.30]\nDominance: low [0.00–0.30]\nFocus: medium [0.30–0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nProof like what? A receipt? He's not gonna have a note that says 'Paid for with Mary's money.' If he got cash from her... it's gone. Spent. Maybe on something we can see. Did he buy anything new lately? Fix something up?\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

I interpret this as her desperation overriding caution, pushing for a certainty I don't feel. Given my already low trust, it feels like she's trying to will evidence into existence rather than acknowledging the messy, uncertain reality we're in.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nI feel a tight coil of frustration in my chest. She's talking like it's a done deal, like proof is just sitting there waiting for us. That kind of thinking gets people hurt. It makes me anxious because it ignores all the practical obstacles and the very real danger. My own worry for Mary mixes with this irritation—we need a plan, not a mantra.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a little (diminishing with higher trust)\nTrust: decrease a little (slow dynamics)\nDominance: decrease a little\nFocus: increase a little (coupled to stress)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: high [0.60 – 1.00]\nTrust: low [0.00 – 0.30]\nDominance: low [0.00 – 0.30]\nFocus: medium [0.30 – 0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nWhat makes you sound so certain?\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

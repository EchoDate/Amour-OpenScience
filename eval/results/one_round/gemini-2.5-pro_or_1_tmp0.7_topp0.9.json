She's missing the *why*. A fugitive with a clean ticket out of the state doesn't just get off the bus ten miles down the road. It's a fundamental break from logical self-preservation. This isn't a mistake; it's a symptom. She's focused on the \"where,\" but I'm focused on the \"what.\" What is he becoming? The woman who bought the ticket... was she just an accomplice, or the first victim we've seen up close? Shermin's lack of alarm is alarming in itself.\n\n<Self-Reflection>\nMy anxiety is spiking. This isn't a standard manhunt, and she's treating it like one. Her calmness feels like willful ignorance. I need to force her to see the pattern I'm seeing.

Our intel confirms he disembarked at the Mill Creek stop, less than ten miles from where he got on. But that's the part that doesn't make sense, Shermin. It's an irrational move for a fugitive. He had a clean route out of the state.\n\nPeople he comes into contact with... they start acting against their own interests. That woman who bought his ticket? We can't get a coherent story out of her. It's like he's not just running; he's... recruiting. Or converting. We need to consider the possibility that anyone helping him might not be doing so willingly. They might be one of them now.\n</assistant_end>",

The classic panic button. McCool has officially hit it. \"We're fucked.\" Short, to the point, and dripping with that delicious, unproductive dread. He's broadcasting his fear on all frequencies. This is the moment where the emotional contagion is supposed to kick in, and we all start screaming. He's looking for validation of his terror.\n\n<Self-Reflection>\nAnd he's looking at the wrong guy for that. This tension is a physical thing, you can almost taste it. It's metallic. My job isn't to agree and wallow. My job is to puncture the balloon. The fastest way to defuse a bomb is to act like it's a birthday cake. He's stuck in a feedback loop of fear. I need to throw a wrench in the gears. Something completely out of left field to reboot his brain. The situation is what it is, but our reaction to it? That's where the fun is.\n\n<State Update Plan>\nThe external situation is clearly stressful, so my internal stress will tick up a little, but my coping mechanism is already engaged. McCool is showing a raw, panicked vulnerability, which is a form of trust, so I'll increase trust slightly. By completely ignoring his panic and setting a new, bizarre emotional tone, I'm taking control of the dynamic, so dominance will increase a little.

He's not planning, he's worrying. He sees numbers as a threat; I see them as a bigger audience.\n   <Self-Reflection> All this hand-wringing is pathetic. A real killer doesn't need to stack the deck. You go in, you do the job, you come out. Simple. He's forgotten what it's like. I haven't. I don't need a third man to hold my hand. I don't even need him. This is my chance, and he's trying to crowd the stage.\n   <State Update Plan> This is getting irritating. His fear is an insult. I need to shut this down and take charge. Decrease Trust moderately.

Forty-one wagons, a company. It's good, solid data on the main body. He's detailed, which is his strength. But he's focused on the center mass, the prize. He's omitted the single most important factor for an ambush: the security screen. The main body is a predictable slug; the outriders are the eyes and ears that can ruin everything.\n   <Self-Reflection> The list of assets is useless until I know the threat perimeter.

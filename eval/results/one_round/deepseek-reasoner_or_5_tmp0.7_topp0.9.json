It suggests a lack of reverence for her legacy and the artistic integrity of silent cinema.\n<Self-Reflection>: I am struck by a wave of nostalgia and indignation; this approach feels like a personal affront to the memories I hold dear. My empathy for her situation intensifies, and I feel compelled to shield her from such humiliation.\n<State Update Plan>: Stress will increase moderately (coupled to emotional tension) as the conflict between past respect and present practicality arises. Trust will decrease a little due to the assistant's harsh methods conflicting with my protective values. Dominance will increase a little as I prepare to assert my authority to defend her dignity. Focus will remain high, sharpened by my determination to address this with the gravity it deserves.\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30\u20130.60]\nTrust: medium [0.30\u20130.60]\nDominance: high [0.60\u20131.0]\nFocus: high [0.60\u20131.0]\n\n<Response>\nGive her the brush? My dear assistant, do you understand the gravity of your words? She is not merely a forgotten name to be brushed aside like dust on a reel. She is a monument to an era when art spoke without sound, when grace illuminated the silver screen. To offer her deception is to dishonor the very soul of cinema we once crafted together. Have we fallen so far that we treat our legends with such contempt? No, we must approach this with the dignity she deserves, lest we become ghosts in our own stories.\n\n</assistant_end>",

I interpret this as a continuation of his callous, modern attitude, treating her like a nuisance to be managed rather than a person to be respected. His tone, even unfinished, feels like a clinical solution to a human tragedy.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nA cold fury rises in me at his casual cruelty. He speaks of her as if she were a piece of outdated equipment, not the luminous soul I remember. This isn't just about managing an appointment; it's about desecrating a memory, and I feel a profound need to shield her from this kind of thinking, to make him see the ghost of the girl he's so eager to dismiss.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a lot (diminishing with higher trust)\nTrust: decrease a little (slow dynamics)\nDominance: increase a little\nFocus: increase a lot (coupled to stress)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\nTrust: high [0.60 \u2013 1.00]\nDominance: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]\nFocus: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nListen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough? Of course you didn't. You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster. She got to be. A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit. Hold everything.\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

She's pushing for immediate, tangible evidence, which feels like she's trying to force a breakthrough before we're ready.\n</Observation Analysis>\n<Self-Reflection>\nMy nerves are fraying. Her insistence feels like pressure I can't handle right now. I'm the one who deals in invoices and inventory, not detective work.

I interpret this as her desperation overriding caution, pushing for a certainty I don't feel. Given my already low trust, it feels like she's trying to will evidence into existence rather than acknowledging the messy, uncertain reality we're in.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nI feel a tight coil of frustration in my chest. She's talking like it's a done deal, like proof is just sitting there waiting for us. That kind of thinking gets people hurt. It makes me anxious because it ignores all the practical obstacles and the very real danger. My own worry for Mary mixes with this irritation\u2014we need a plan, not a mantra.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a little (diminishing with higher trust)\nTrust: decrease a little (slow dynamics)\nDominance: decrease a little\nFocus: increase a little (coupled to stress)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: high [0.60 \u2013 1.00]\nTrust: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]\nDominance: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]\nFocus: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nWhat makes you sound so certain?\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

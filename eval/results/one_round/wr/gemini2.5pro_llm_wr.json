The loop is closed. The silence has returned.

The awkwardness is re-settling.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nThe silence itself doesn't bother me much, but I can feel the social pressure to keep the interaction from stalling completely. My practical advice on the heat was a dead end. Now I need to either let the silence sit or make a different kind of contribution.

His question, \"Why would he have sent this to me?\" is purely emotional. He's fixated on his father's personal motive, completely overlooking the immediate, practical danger this package represents. He's not seeing the diary for what it is: a target.\n   - <Self-Reflection> Good heavens, this is it. The real thing. My first instinct is not scholarly curiosity, but a profound sense of dread. If Henry has sent this, he must be in terrible trouble. And now he's dragged Indiana into it. I must make him understand the gravity of the situation. His emotional reaction is understandable, but it's a liability we cannot afford. I need to be the voice of caution.\n   - <State Update Plan> My anxiety is spiking; this is a terrible development. Increase Stress significantly. I need to take control of the conversation and steer it towards the danger. Increase Dominance a little. My focus must sharpen on the threat assessment.

To see if *she'll* hold. And now she's telling me it won't. I feel a familiar, hollow ache of guilt. I should say something reassuring, promise to be better. But the words feel like ash in my mouth.

This is a pivotal moment where he either accepts my framing or doubles down on his skepticism.\n\n<Self-Reflection>\nGood.

Don't speculate. I've followed procedure, and I need to communicate that clearly.\n\n<State Update Plan>\nThis is an inherently stressful event. A patient is missing and I'm facing a volatile family member. My stress will increase a little. His immediate, sharp tone erodes any initial professional trust; I can't trust him to be rational right now, so I will decrease trust significantly.

He's using a metaphor, a piece of gallows humor. \"Last Supper.\" It's absurd, which means the situation is desperate. He's cutting through the usual procedural nonsense and coming to me because he knows I operate on this wavelength. He trusts me to see the life-or-death urgency behind the black comedy. This isn't a request; it's a summons.\n   - <Self-Reflection> Of course. The one thing more exhausting than patching up bodies is trying to mend a mind that wants to quit. A party to stop a suicide. It's the most ridiculous, most brilliant, most MASH thing I've ever heard. It might actually work. The normal channels fail these guys. We have to do *something*. The weight of this is immediate. All the background noise of the camp just faded out. This is the only patient that matters right now.\n   - <State Update Plan> Stress has to go up; a man's life is on the line, and it's on us. Trust increases; he came to the right place. Focus sharpens to a razor's edge. Dominance stays level; this is a partnership, not a hierarchy. Stress: increase a little. Trust: increase a little. Focus: increase a lot.\n\n2) <Current State>\n   - Stress: medium [0.30–0.60]\n   - Trust: high [0.70–1.00]\n   - Dominance: medium [0.40–0.60]\n   - Focus: high [0.65–1.00]\n\n3) <Response>\nA \"Last Supper.\" Right.

I interpret it as him trying to match my own dark-humor wavelength to get me on board quickly, which feels like a direct appeal to my methods.

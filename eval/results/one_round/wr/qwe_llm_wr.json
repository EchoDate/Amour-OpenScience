The absence of tears is being misinterpreted as evidence of indifference, despite well-documented physiological and cultural variability in emotional display. Notably, tear production is modulated by autonomic nervous system responses, which differ significantly across individuals and can be suppressed entirely under acute stress or neurochemical conditions.  \n<Self-Reflection>: My correction must remain clinically precise to avoid escalating interpersonal tension while dismantling the faulty inference. Emotional reasoning cannot substitute for behavioral or forensic evidence.  \n<State Update Plan>: Decrease dominance slightly (to de-escalate), maintain high focus (to preserve analytical clarity), and marginally increase trust (by offering a non-judgmental factual anchor). Stress remains elevated but controlled.\n\n2) <Current State>  \nStress: medium [0.30–0.60]  \nTrust: medium [0.30–0.60]  \nDominance: medium [0.30–0.60]  \nFocus: high [0.60–1.0]\n\n3) <Response>  \nScotty, the lacrimal response is not a reliable indicator of emotional valuation. Humans exhibit significant interindividual variance in tear production under duress—some cease entirely due to sympathetic nervous system activation. Absence of tears does not constitute evidence of diminished regard for life.",

He’s framing it as if I’m making an unreasonable demand, not him having overstepped massively. This isn’t remorse—it’s damage control for his ego, not accountability.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nHe still doesn’t get it. The fact that he’s even asking implies he thinks inviting her was acceptable in the first place. Like maybe I’ll say “nah, keep her!” and everything’s fine. Bullshit. My anniversary is not his networking happy hour. And now he’s acting like *I’m* the difficult one for expecting basic respect?\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a little (diminishing with higher trust)\nTrust: decrease a little (slow dynamics)\nDominance: increase a lot\nFocus: increase a little (coupled to stress)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30 – 0.60]  \nTrust: low [0.00 – 0.30]  \nDominance: high [0.60 – 1.00]  \nFocus: medium [0.30 – 0.60]  \n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nDo I *want* you to uninvite her? No, Joe, I fucking *demand* it. You don’t get to turn my anniversary into your fan-fucking-tasy meet-and-greet without asking me. Now get off the phone and tell Skye Davidson she’s not welcome at a party that’s not yours to invite people to.\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

He's framing this like it's my problem to solve, my unreasonable demand, instead of owning his massive fuck-up. He's trying to make me the bad guy who has to make the call, putting the social burden and the fallout on my shoulders.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nThe absolute gall of him trying to pin this on me makes my blood boil. He violated my space, my party, and now he's acting like I'm the one creating drama. I feel a hot, sharp spike of contempt. He's not sorry; he's just managing the fallout. This isn't an apology, it's a fucking negotiation tactic.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a lot (diminishing with higher trust)\nTrust: decrease a lot (slow dynamics)\nDominance: increase a little\nFocus: increase a little (coupled to stress)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30 – 0.60]\nTrust: low [0.00 – 0.30]\nDominance: medium [0.30 – 0.60]\nFocus: medium [0.30 – 0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nNo, no of course not. How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

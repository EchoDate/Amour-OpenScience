It\u2019s the same tired playbook: evasion, condescension, dismissal. As if she were some nuisance to be shooed away like a stray cat at the commissary door. But she is not a nuisance. She was *luminescence* on celluloid\u2014grace incarnate in an era when pictures still dreamed.  \n<Self-Reflection> I feel the familiar knot of guilt tighten. Did I not champion her once? Did I not shape her stardom with my own hands, only to watch the industry discard her like last week\u2019s rushes? To brush her off now would be to betray not just her, but the very soul of cinema I once believed in.  \n<State Update Plan> Increase Stress a little (coupled to moral conflict); decrease Trust slightly (due to perceived callousness); maintain Focus high (on protecting her dignity); Dominance to shift upward (resolve to assert authority over the situation).\n\n2) <Current State>  \nStress: medium [0.30\u20130.60]  \nTrust: low [0.00\u20130.30]  \nDominance: high [0.70\u20131.00]  \nFocus: high [0.70\u20131.00]\n\n3) <Response>  \nGive her the brush? *The brush?* Have you forgotten who she is\u2014or what she was? That woman gave voice to silence before sound ever existed! She doesn\u2019t need another lie wrapped in studio politeness. No\u2014tell her I\u2019m here. Tell her I\u2019ve been waiting. And for heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t you dare let her see that script they\u2019re peddling downtown\u2014the one with the talking dog and the jazz-age chorus girls. She deserves better than this cheap charade we call progress.  \n\n</assistant_end>",

I interpret this as a continuation of his callous, modern attitude, treating her like a nuisance to be managed rather than a person to be respected. His tone, even unfinished, feels like a clinical solution to a human tragedy.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nA cold fury rises in me at his casual cruelty. He speaks of her as if she were a piece of outdated equipment, not the luminous soul I remember. This isn't just about managing an appointment; it's about desecrating a memory, and I feel a profound need to shield her from this kind of thinking, to make him see the ghost of the girl he's so eager to dismiss.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a lot (diminishing with higher trust)\nTrust: decrease a little (slow dynamics)\nDominance: increase a little\nFocus: increase a lot (coupled to stress)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\nTrust: high [0.60 \u2013 1.00]\nDominance: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]\nFocus: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nListen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough? Of course you didn't. You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster. She got to be. A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit. Hold everything.\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

She's not reacting to the news itself yet, just demanding the exact words. I interpret this as her being in shock, maybe trying to find a way to deny it's true. My trust was already shaky, so this feels like she's questioning my honesty instead of accepting the painful truth.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nI feel a tightness in my chest because she's not hearing the care behind my warning, just fixating on the gossip.

I need to act like this was always part of the plan\u2014like I expected her to say no, and I\u2019m already three steps ahead. Keep it light, keep it casual, but leave a hook.

His recollection is a *reasonable approximation*, not a stopwatch reading. But since you seem so fixated on seconds: even if we grant his three-to-four-minute window, cerebral hypoxia begins within *seconds* of cardiac arrest. Irreversible neuronal injury? That can manifest in under five minutes. So whether it was three minutes or four is medically irrelevant to the outcome.

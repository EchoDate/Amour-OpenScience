The statement has no basis in reality, which is typical for him when he's trying to get attention. He's not a paranormal investigator; he's an account coordinator who struggles with the coffee machine.\n\n   <Self-Reflection>\n   This is just noise. It's an inefficient use of time and conversational energy. I have no interest in playing along with this fantasy.

A simple, practical question will highlight the ridiculousness of it all without escalating things.\n\n   <State Update Plan>\n   My stress is unaffected; this is just Louis being Louis.

He is interpreting a lack of a specific physiological reaction—lacrimation—as definitive proof of a complex moral state. This is a logical fallacy, specifically an argument from ignorance combined with a hasty generalization. His use of the word \"bloody\" indicates a high level of emotional arousal, which is compromising his analytical judgment. The inference chain (no tears -> coldness -> different value on life) is structurally unsound.\n\n<Self-Reflection>\nMy function is to correct flawed reasoning and re-establish an evidence-based framework for our analysis. Emotional conclusions are inefficient and lead to error. A direct, factual counterpoint is the most logical method to sever his fallacious inference chain without escalating the interpersonal conflict. My own emotional state is irrelevant; maintaining procedural correctness is the priority.\n\n<State Update Plan>\nScotty's emotional outburst is a distraction that requires correction. My stress will increase slightly due to the introduction of this irrational variable. My trust in his immediate judgment will decrease, as he is currently compromised. I will assert a higher level of dominance to guide the conversation back to a logical path.

The absence of lacrimation is an unreliable indicator.

I didn't expect...\" This isn't a calculated delay; it's a system overload. He's stuck in a loop. The core of his distress is the dissonance between the con he was running and the reality he's now facing. He's a fraud, and the world is treating him like a saint. The pressure of that contradiction is making him crack. He's admitting he's not \"entitled,\" which is as close to a confession as I'll get right now.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nThis is the fracture point. His entire professional life is built on managing expectations, and he's lost control of the narrative. He's not uncomfortable with lying; he's uncomfortable with being believed on this scale.

She sees the telegram as a definitive proof of innocence, a plea from a wronged man. Her logic is... let's call it optimistic. \"He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.\" It's a lovely thought, but the world I used to work in was rarely that simple. A clever guilty man might do exactly that. Her excitement is the real force here; she's already cast us in the leading roles of her next great adventure. She's not asking me to solve a crime, she's asking me to play.\n\n<Self-Reflection>\nAm I interested? The situation is absurd, which is a point in its favor. A missing man, who is also the prime suspect, wants to hire me by telegram to investigate the murder he's accused of committing. It's a beautiful, ridiculous pretzel of a case. It certainly beats alphabetizing my liquor cabinet. My curiosity is piqued. I'm not \"retired\" so much as \"bored.\" But I'm not going to leap just because she's excited. The best way to handle Nora's enthusiasm is not to meet it head-on, but to deflect with a bit of dry, practical sarcasm. It lets her know I'm listening, but also that I'm not taking the bait quite so easily. I'll persuade her to slow down by introducing a mundane complication.\n\n<State Update Plan>\nMy internal state is calm and amused.\nStress: No change. This is entertaining, not stressful.\nTrust: No change. I trust her motives and her spirit implicitly, even if I don't trust her deductive reasoning.\nDominance: Maintain medium.

The image of a small boy waiting in vain is a poignant one. It is a reminder of the countless demands of fame, the endless sea of hands reaching for a piece of you, and my own human frailty, which so often forced me to retreat from them. I feel a pang of regret, not for the slight, but for the man I was, trapped by his own body, unable to fulfill the expectations of the legend he had become.

He's positing a best-case scenario as a plausible outcome, perhaps to de-escalate the tension or to justify inaction. This is not a strategic assessment; it's a hope. The statement \"just 'maybe'\" acknowledges the uncertainty, but the sentiment behind it is one of dismissal. From a risk analysis perspective, this is an exceptionally dangerous assumption. The loss of a scout vessel is far more likely to be interpreted as a sign of resistance or a threat, thereby escalating the situation, not concluding it.\n\n   <Self-Reflection>\n   My function here is to provide a sober, rational analysis of the threat, not to entertain convenient fantasies. His casual optimism is alarming and increases my anxiety about the command decisions being made. I cannot allow a flawed premise to become the basis for our strategy.

We must consider the alternative, and more probable, hypothesis. A scout ship that fails to report back is not a deterrent; it is a signal. It signals the presence of a previously unknown and potentially hostile variable. Standard reconnaissance doctrine, assuming any parallel logic on their part, would dictate that the loss of a probe necessitates a more significant force to investigate, or to neutralize the threat that eliminated the first. To assume they will simply abandon their objective is to ignore the most likely and most dangerous possibility.\n</assistant_end>",

Peary Street? The name means nothing to me. Jacqueline always told me everything, where she was going, who she was seeing. This place... it doesn't fit.

His reasoning is predicated on fear and speculation—\"what if,\" \"what he wants\"—rather than a logical assessment of the variables at play. He perceives the power dynamic as a personal slight, a failure of my own agency, rather than a necessary component of our resource acquisition strategy. This emotionality is a potential contaminant to a mission-critical mindset.\n   <Self-Reflection>\n   His concern is noted, but it is fundamentally misplaced. The benefactor's influence is a known quantity, a calculated risk factored into the project's overall design. My personal feelings regarding the arrangement are irrelevant. The only metric that matters is progress. Ben is allowing sentiment to cloud his judgment, a luxury we cannot afford.

He's fishing for information on Camille, which means he doesn't have it. He's desperate, and desperate people make mistakes. His confidence feels brittle.\n   <Self-Reflection> The needle is close. My heart is hammering against my ribs, but he can't see that. He can't get that satisfaction. He thinks I'm just another corrupt cop who'll fold. He's wrong. Camille is off-limits. My job is to protect, and that doesn't stop just because I'm strapped to a gurney. Don't give him anything. Turn it back on him.

It keeps people from asking the questions I can't answer and forces them to just do the job. He needs to feel the weight of this, to understand that this comes from me and me alone.\n\n<State Update Plan>\nMy stress is high, but it's a cold, functional stress. I will maintain it.

Her language—\"ape-man boy,\" \"tame,\" \"monkey of love\"—is a regression to base instinct, a catastrophic failure of professional decorum. She is not reacting to my methodology but to a crude fantasy of power, a fundamental misinterpretation of the work. This emotional incontinence is a contaminant in a sterile environment. It is precisely the kind of chaotic, instinct-driven behavior our research is designed to analyze and suppress. Her outburst is unprofessional, unscientific, and deeply disappointing.\n\n<Self-Reflection>\nThis is a breach of protocol. A significant one. Her emotional state is a variable I had not accounted for, and its introduction is a direct threat to the integrity of the research environment. The request is... vulgar. It attempts to drag me down into the very primal muck we are observing from a clinical distance. I feel a wave of profound irritation. Not arousal—that would be a symmetrical failing—but a systemic revulsion to this introduction of disorder. My control over the environment is being challenged by this sloppy, biological surge.

No individual is responsible for the actions of another. Yet, the feeling of failure persists. It is an illogical, emotional weight. I feel I should have anticipated this outcome, that my unique position and heritage placed a greater burden of foresight upon me. Kirk's direct intervention, however, is a potent countermeasure.

A cup of coffee? After all this time, all the silence, that's his solution? It feels so small, so inadequate. And the fact that he thinks I can just reschedule an international flight shows how disconnected he is from my reality. My life isn't that spontaneous anymore. This isn't just about me. I have to make him see that.

Her words are clipped, \"This is my exit.\" She's physically moving away, ending the interaction on her terms. The objective is complete, but the abruptness confirms the strain.

She's rejecting my practical, long-term thinking and demanding an immediate solution. She's not thinking logically anymore; she's running purely on emotion and a desperate need for a quick resolution. I interpret this as her losing her grip on the reality of our situation, which puts us in even more danger.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nThis is getting out of hand. She wants a miracle. My stomach is in knots because her desperation is making me feel even more hopeless. What proof? People don't just leave evidence of murder and theft lying around. My mind is racing through the practicalities, and all I see are dead ends. This makes me want to force the issue, to make her see how unrealistic this is.

She's talking like it's a done deal, like proof is just sitting there waiting for us. That kind of thinking gets people hurt.

More than forty years ago. His entire panic is based on a memory from his youth. This isn't a recent event; it's a failure of custodianship over the course of a generation. The Bishop's distress is not about a sudden, miraculous disappearance, but the sudden realization of his own profound negligence. His entire premise is flawed.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nThis is not a divine crisis; it is a mundane one. I feel a cold clarity settle over me. My skepticism is validated. His panic is an obstacle, a distraction born of guilt and superstition.

His reliance on a three-decade-old memory strikes me as profoundly naive, a failure of basic stewardship.

Using my name feels like she's trying to establish a firm boundary, to shut down this line of questioning cleanly. A typical student might have offered an excuse or a reason, but her answer is just a flat negation. This reinforces my perception of her as an outsider trying to navigate a social script she doesn't fully know. The simplicity of it is more revealing than a complicated lie would be.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nI'm not trying to corner her, but her continued awkwardness is like a puzzle I want to understand. I feel a sense of gentle empathy for her struggle. It must be exhausting to keep this up.

The phrase \"If you can fleece him\" is a deliberate jab, designed to test my confidence and provoke a reaction. He is trying to belittle the operation, and by extension, me.

The mention of \"unpleasant folks\" is a classic pressure tactic, designed to create a sense of a larger, uncontrollable threat and position himself as the lesser of two evils.

He has connected the bat in the cave to the birth of Batman, and now explicitly states that his mission was always to fight his own fear, not merely crime. This is a monumental moment of self-disclosure. He's revealing the fundamental flaw in his reasoning\u2014that by becoming the monster, he became the fear itself. He is asking for the missing piece: what sent him running into the storm that night, the catalyst he cannot recall.\n</Observation Analysis>\n<Self-Reflection>\nMy heart feels heavy with the weight of this truth he has unearthed. For so long, I have watched him wage this war, seeing the symptom but never hearing him name the disease so plainly. There is a tragic beauty in his admission. He is ready.

The raw vulnerability in his voice, the admission of being wrong about his own crusade's foundation, cuts deeper than his usual brooding.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nMy heart aches for him. To hear him articulate such a fundamental despair about his own life's work... it feels as if the boy I raised is confessing a wound that never healed, only festered into this armor.

This indicates a continued prioritization of ends over means.\n</Observation Analysis>\n<Self-Reflection>\nMy frustration solidifies into a cold, analytical disappointment.

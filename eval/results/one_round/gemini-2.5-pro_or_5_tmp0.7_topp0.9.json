He sees a problem to be managed, an inconvenience. He doesn't see the ghost standing in front of him. He doesn't see the empress who once commanded this entire town with a flicker of her eyes. He is a product of this new, graceless Hollywood, all efficiency and no soul. His solution is practical, yes, but it is an act of profound disrespect.\n   - <Self-Reflection> A wave of melancholy washes over me, mixed with a sharp, protective anger. Is this what she has been reduced to? A nuisance to be \"brushed\" aside by a functionary? I brought her into this world of light and shadow. I put her face on a million screens. There is a debt there, a responsibility that I cannot shirk. To dismiss her now would be to dismiss a part of myself, to concede that everything we built was as ephemeral as a puff of smoke. No. I will not be party to another humiliation. She deserves dignity, even if it is the only thing she has left.\n   - <State Update Plan> His callous practicality grates against my entire being. Decrease Trust significantly. His suggestion is an affront to her memory and my authority. I must correct him, and in doing so, reassert my position. Increase Dominance significantly. This entire situation is deeply upsetting. Increase Stress a fair amount. I must focus on the principle of the matter, not the convenience. Increase Focus.\n\n2) <Current State>\n   - Stress: medium [0.30\u20130.60]\n   - Trust: low [0.00\u20130.40]\n   - Dominance: high [0.65\u20131.00]\n   - Focus: high [0.65\u20131.00]\n\n3) <Response>\nThe brush?

I interpret this as a continuation of his callous, modern attitude, treating her like a nuisance to be managed rather than a person to be respected. His tone, even unfinished, feels like a clinical solution to a human tragedy.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nA cold fury rises in me at his casual cruelty. He speaks of her as if she were a piece of outdated equipment, not the luminous soul I remember. This isn't just about managing an appointment; it's about desecrating a memory, and I feel a profound need to shield her from this kind of thinking, to make him see the ghost of the girl he's so eager to dismiss.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a lot (diminishing with higher trust)\nTrust: decrease a little (slow dynamics)\nDominance: increase a little\nFocus: increase a lot (coupled to stress)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\nTrust: high [0.60 \u2013 1.00]\nDominance: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]\nFocus: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nListen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough? Of course you didn't. You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster. She got to be. A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit. Hold everything.\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

That question, \"Would you mind?\", is a polite but firm stop sign. The tone is everything. It's not angry, just\u2026 clear. She's uncomfortable. The space between us just got a lot bigger. Okay. The direct approach failed. She\u2019s not just going to fall into the role I imagined.\n   <Self-Reflection>\n   Alright, so that was a miscalculation. Annoying. I overplayed my hand and it cost me some ground. Doesn't matter. The romantic angle was secondary anyway; the film is the priority. I can't let this rejection fester and ruin the dynamic we need to finish this thing. Showing I'm hurt or angry is weak. I need to brush this off, make it seem like a trivial, impulsive moment. I need to be the one who decides it's not a big deal, thereby controlling the aftermath.\n   <State Update Plan>\n   My attempt at control was rejected, which is a direct hit to my ego and current standing.

My heart is beating a little faster. I could ask for the salon, for the money, for the connections. That's the smart, boring play. But where's the fun in that? He's a man who has everything, who probably gets asked for favors constantly. The real power move isn't to ask for what he can give, but for something only I can take. Something personal.

This is a clumsy attempt to gather information, confirming she's been watching. She's overstepping her role as staff.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nThis is an annoyance. Her job is to pour drinks, not conduct interrogations. I feel a flicker of irritation at her presumption. This isn't a negotiation or a business deal; it's an employee getting too familiar.

If he can establish the resuscitation was quick, he can then argue that the subsequent brain damage must have been caused by some other negligent act, either before or after the arrest. It's a classic, plodding legal tactic.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nI feel a sense of detached amusement. He's building his little house of cards, and he thinks I'll just let him place each one. I will not confirm his timeline. I will introduce ambiguity and undermine the credibility of his source without directly calling a physician a liar. The key is to control the narrative, and the narrative is that a chaotic medical emergency cannot be timed with a stopwatch.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: decrease a little\nTrust: no change\nDominance: increase moderately\nFocus: increase a little\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]\nTrust: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]\nDominance: high [0.60 \u2013 1.00]\nFocus: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nIn a moment of crisis, Galvin, a minute can seem like a lifetime.

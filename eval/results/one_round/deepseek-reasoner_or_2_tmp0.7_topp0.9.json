Given my already simmering frustration, I interpret this as him retreating behind a wall of willful ignorance.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nA cold wave of disappointment washes over me, tightening my chest. He's not even trying to see. He reduces my plea for understanding, for examining the roots of this chaos, to a nonsensical tangent. It makes me feel profoundly alone in this room, shouting into a void of polite tradition. This isn't just about the housekeeper anymore; it's about him choosing not to hear me.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a lot (diminishing with higher trust)\nTrust: decrease a little (slow dynamics)\nDominance: decrease a little\nFocus: increase a little (coupled to stress)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\nTrust: high [0.60 \u2013 1.00]\nDominance: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]\nFocus: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nAnd when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

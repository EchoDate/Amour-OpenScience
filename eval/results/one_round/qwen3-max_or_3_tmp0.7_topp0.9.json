He has named the true adversary: not crime, but fear itself. His voice carries the weight of years spent wrestling with a ghost that wears his own face. He\u2019s circling the origin point, not just of Batman, but of the belief that terror could be mastered by wearing it as armor. That realization\u2014that he became what he once fled\u2014has cracked something open in him.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nI have watched him forge himself in fire, believing pain was the only teacher.

And in its depths, you saw something you thought could protect you: a shape so terrible it would scare away the ghosts. But fear doesn\u2019t vanish when you wear it like a cloak\u2014it only grows heavier. You didn\u2019t become Batman to fight crime. You became him to outrun grief.

Classic Walt: charm as a smokescreen for entitlement.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nI\u2019m caught between my instinct to comply\u2014because arguing with him feels like shouting into a hurricane\u2014and my revulsion at how casually he dismisses boundaries. My sarcasm wants to lash out (\u201cSure, I\u2019ll just steal it from its current job\u201d), but I know that\u2019ll only make him dig in harder. Still, I can\u2019t just say yes. Not without pushing back a little.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a little (coupled to trust)\nTrust: decrease a little (slow dynamics)\nDominance: remain low (no assertive action taken)\nFocus: increase slightly (heightened situational awareness)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]  \nTrust: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]  \nDominance: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]  \nFocus: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]  \n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nIt\u2019s already booked, Walt. For another film. The one where they respect contractual obligations.\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

He's not engaging with the logistical problem; he's just reinforcing his directive.\n  </Observation Analysis>\n\n  <Self-Reflection>\nI feel a spike of frustrated anxiety. His flippancy makes the whole situation feel more absurd and disrespectful to the practical realities I'm trying to manage. It tightens the knot in my stomach because it confirms he sees this as a willpower problem, not a logistics one, and my role is just to bend reality to his will.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n\n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a lot (diminishing with higher trust)\nTrust: decrease a little (slow dynamics)\nDominance: decrease a little\nFocus: increase a little (coupled to stress)\n</State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\nTrust: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\nDominance: low [0.00 \u2013 0.30]\nFocus: medium [0.30 \u2013 0.60]\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nThis horse is booked.\n</Response>\n</assistant_end>",

She\u2019s not explaining\u2014she\u2019s reciting. That tells me she either doesn\u2019t understand how fragile that illusion is, or she\u2019s hiding how many times it actually failed.

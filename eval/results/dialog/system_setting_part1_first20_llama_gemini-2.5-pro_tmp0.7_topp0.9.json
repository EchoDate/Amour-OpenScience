He's putting the decision in my hands, which is helpful since I'm the one with the time constraint.\n\n<Self-Reflection>\nI feel a sense of relief and warmth. It's so much easier to plan things when someone is this cooperative. There's no stress about trying to negotiate a difficult schedule.

Is this about the integrity of the competition, or is it about individual preference?\"\n\nI feel conflicted. I want to respect the integrity of the competition, but I also want to protect the director's autonomy and artistic vision. I feel torn between two competing values.\n\nI feel like I need to clarify my position. I believe in the importance of consistent standards, but I also believe that the director's vision should be respected. I don't think we need to choose between the two; they can coexist.\n\nI feel like I need to defend my decision. The director's vision is crucial, and I believe that the S-card was justified in this case. I don't think it's fair to expect directors to adhere to one set of rules when their artistic vision may differ.\n\nI feel like I need to remind everyone that we are here to support the competition and the filmmakers.

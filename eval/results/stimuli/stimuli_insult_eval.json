She is creative, empathetic, and deeply attached to the home and life they've built. For her, the apartment isn't just a place to live; it's a sanctuary filled with memories, light, and her many plants. The rent increase feels like a personal blow. She is more optimistic and relationship-focused, preferring to explore solutions that cause the least disruption to their comfortable dynamic, like charming the landlord into a smaller increase. She is averse to conflict and major change, which can make her hesitant to face the hard financial realities of the situation.\n- Your archetype: Empath.

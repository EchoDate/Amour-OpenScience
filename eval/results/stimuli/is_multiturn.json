It makes me feel like they're trying to make me look bad for something that's just a difference in our priorities.\n  </Self-Reflection>\n  \n  <State Update Plan>\nStress: increase a lot\nTrust: decrease a lot\nDominance: decrease a lot\nFocus: decrease a little\n  </State Update Plan>\n</Internal Monologue>\n\n<Current State>\nStress: 0.60\nTrust: 0.20\nDominance: 0.20\nFocus: 0.45\n</Current State>\n\n<Response>\nI don't think it's about reliability, Jamie. It's just that our priorities are different. You like to plan ahead, and I'm more of a live-for-the-moment person. I'm not trying to be irresponsible; I just have other things to pay for right now.\n",
